# App Overview
Pronouncer is an app dedicated to helping people learn English. More specifically, the app will focus on helping people improve their pronunciation.

The user will be able to search for words and add them. They will also be able to set how many words they want to do per day.

The goal of the user will be to pronounce the word correctly. The app will use the iphone's microphone to grab the user's speech, and will tell the user whether they said it correctly or not.

If the user needs help, the app will also be able to use text-to-speech to pronounce the word, at both a normal and slow pace. This will help the user learn how to say the word.
